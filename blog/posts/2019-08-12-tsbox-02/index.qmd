[The tsbox package](https://www.tsbox.help/) makes life with time series
in R easier. It is built around a set of functions that convert time
series of different classes to each other. They are frequency-agnostic
and allow the user to combine time series of multiple non-standard and irregular
frequencies. A detailed overview of the package functionality
is given in the [documentation page](https://www.tsbox.help/) (or in a
[previous
blog-post](https://www.cynkra.com/blog/2018-05-15-tsbox/)).


Version 0.2 is now on CRAN and provides a larger number of bug fixes.
Non-standard column names are now handled correctly, and
non-standard column orders are treated consistently.

## New Classes

There are two more time series classes supported: `tis` time series,
from the [tis](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tis) package, and
`irts` time series, from the
[tseries](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tseries) package.

To create an object of these classes, it is sufficient to use
the appropriate converter.

E.g., for `tis` time series:

``` r
library(tsbox)
ts_tis(fdeaths)
```

    ## class: tis

Or for `irts` time series:

``` r
head(ts_irts(fdeaths))
```

    ## 1974-01-01 00:00:00 GMT 901
    ## 1974-02-01 00:00:00 GMT 689

Conversion works from all classes to all classes, and we can easily
convert these objects to any other time series class, or a data
frame:

``` r
x.tis <- ts_tis(fdeaths)
head(ts_df(x.tis))
```

    ##         time value
    ## 1 1974-01-01   901
    ## 2 1974-02-01   689
    ## 3 1974-03-01   827
    ## 4 1974-04-01   677
    ## 5 1974-05-01   522
    ## 6 1974-06-01   406

## Class-agnostic functions

Because coercion works reliably and is well tested, we can use
it to make functions class-agnostic. If a class-agnostic function
works for one class, it works for all:

``` r
ts_pc(ts_tis(fdeaths))
ts_pc(ts_irts(fdeaths))
ts_pc(ts_df(fdeaths))
ts_pc(fdeaths)
```

`ts_pc` calculates percentage change rates towards the previous period.
It works like a ‘generic’ function: You can apply it on any time series
object, and it will return an object of the same class as its input.

So, whether we want to smooth, scale, differentiate, chain-link,
forecast, regularize, or seasonally adjust a series, we can use the same
commands to all time series classes. tsbox offers a comprehensive
toolkit for the basics of time series manipulation. Here are some
additional examples:

``` r
ts_pcy(fdeaths)                # p.c., compared do same period of prev. year
ts_forecast(fdeaths)           # forecast, by exponential smoothing
ts_seas(fdeaths)               # seasonal adjustment, by X-13
ts_frequency(fdeaths, "year")  # convert to annual frequency
ts_span(fdeaths, "-1 year")    # limit time span to final year
```

[There are many more](https://www.tsbox.help/reference/index.html).
Because they all start with `ts_`, you can use auto-complete to see
what’s around. Most conveniently, there is a time series plot function
that works for all classes and frequencies:

``` r
ts_plot(
  `Airline Passengers` = AirPassengers,
  `Lynx trappings` = ts_tis(lynx),
  `Deaths from Lung Diseases` = ts_xts(fdeaths),
  title = "Airlines, trappings, and deaths",
  subtitle = "Monthly passengers, annual trappings, monthly deaths"
)
```
