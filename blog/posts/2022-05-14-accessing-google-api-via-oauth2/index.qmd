At cynkra we recently aimed to automate more parts of our internal toolstack.
One tool is Google Workspace.
Google Workspace offers a [comprehensive REST API](https://developers.google.com/workspace) which can be used for automation purposes.

When interacting with an API, authentication is usually required.
This is commonly done by adding a header to the request which includes an access token along with the actual API request.
For many APIs these headers can be simple single access token of type ["Bearer"](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/).
These tokens often have no expiration date and infinite scopes, meaning they can be used for any kind of request against the respective API endpoints.
The risk with these tokens is that they are quite powerful and an attacker can somewhat easily get infinite access to your account, both in terms of scopes and time.

Therefore, many services recently started to favor the use of [OAuth2](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/oauth2/) in a multi-stage authentication concept.
The process can be broken down as follows:

1. An admin creates an OAuth2 app in the respective service (e.g. Google Cloud or Zoom) with limited scopes (i.e. only to certain parts of the API)
2. First an encoded "JSON Web Token" (JWT) must be created.
   In the specific case of the Google API, an access key and its secret from a Google "Service Account" (which needs to be created in the "Credentials" menu of Google Cloud) are required for signing the JWT during creation.
3. Next an API call makes a request against the OAuth2 app using the just created JWT token and gets a short-lived *Bearer* access token returned.
4. A third API call issues the actual API request.

This multi-stage process can be automated by using automation tools like *Ansible* or similar.
Yet the tricky part is usually the authentication against the OAuth2 app.
Traditionally OAuth2 apps aim for GUI-based interaction, i.e., someone clicking a button to authorize the request.
However, when aiming for automation via an API, this is not feasible.
Instead the OAuth2 app should return the access token as code to further continue the automated workflow.

## The "OOB" deprecation

For many years there was a workaround by using `redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` combined with `response_type=code` which was [widely shared across the web](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12710262/google-drive-redirect-uri-mismatch) and Youtube.
Yet in Feburary 2022 Google finally [blocked this approach](https://developers.googleblog.com/2022/02/making-oauth-flows-safer.html#instructions-oob) as it is considered unsafe and more secure methods should be used.

## The "JWT" authentication approach

Hence a new approach is needed to authenticate against Google OAuth2 apps programmatically.
One of these is the use of [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) (JWT).
These are different to *Bearer* tokens in the way that they must be signed and encrypted using a domain-wide access token and am specific algorithm which the OAuth2 apps expects (for future decoding purposes).
The mentioned encryption is also not straightforward and usually requires [the use of an additional language](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#authorizingrequests) (e.g. Python, Ruby, Java) and a respective module which does the encryption.
The key and its secret (in the Google case) which should be encrypted must be generated within a *service account* that was granted [*domain-wide delegation*](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation).
If such an encrypted JWT is sent to the OAuth2 app, it can verify the owner and issue a short-lived token with the respective scopes of the OAuth2 app.

## Ansible workflow example

All of the above made the process of issueing a "simple" API call against the Google API quite cumbersome.
This is why in the following a fully-working ansible approach is provided which uses a Ruby script for the initial JWT encryption.

This assumes

- a working Ruby installation at `/usr/bin/ruby`
- an existing Google service account with *domain wide delegation*
- an OAuth2 app to which the service account has acccess to with matching scopes required for the final API call

*Disclaimer: The `jwt.rb` script below and parts of the ansible logic are taken/adapted from another blog post which I am unable to find again.*
*Memo to myself: always instantly store the link somewhere if you find some helpful content on a website...*

```yml
- name: "Google Workspace: Create JWT for Google OAuth2"
  command: >
    env ruby <path/to/>/jwt.rb --iss "google-workspace@<some service account name>.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    --sub "<issuer email>" --scope "{% raw %}{{ google_workspace_oauth2_api_scopes | join(' ') }}{% endraw %}"
    --kid "{% raw %}{{ google_workspace_oauth2_key_id.value }}{% endraw %}"
    --pkey "{% raw %}{{ google_workspace_oauth2_private_key.value }}{% endraw %}"
  args: { chdir: "/usr/bin/" }
  register: jwt
```

Here `google_workspace_oauth2_api_scopes` is a list of Google API scopes

```yml
google_workspace_oauth2_api_scopes:
  - 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user'
  - 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group'
  - 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.domain'
  - 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.userschema'
  - 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/apps.licensing'
```

and `google_workspace_oauth2_key_id` and `google_workspace_oauth2_private_key` are the credentials from the respective service account used.

The `jwt.rb` file referenced in the call above looks as follows:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

require 'jwt'
require 'optparse'
require 'openssl'

options = {}
OptionParser.new do |opts|
  opts.banner = 'Usage: jwt.rb [options]'

  opts.on('--iss ISS', 'Issuer') do |iss|
    options[:iss] = iss
  end
  opts.on('--sub SUB', 'Subject') do |sub|
    options[:sub] = sub
  end
  opts.on('--scope SCOPE', 'API Scopes') do |scope|
    options[:scope] = scope
  end
  opts.on('--kid KID', 'Key id') do |kid|
    options[:kid] = kid
  end
  opts.on('--pkey PKEY', 'Key') do |pkey|
    options[:pkey] = pkey
  end
end.parse!

iat = Time.now.to_i
exp = iat + 900 # token is 900s valid

payload = { iss: options[:iss].to_s,
            sub: options[:sub].to_s,
            scope: options[:scope].to_s,
            aud: 'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token',
            kid: options[:kid].to_s,
            exp: exp,
            iat: iat }

pkey = options[:pkey].to_s.gsub('\n', "\n")
priv_key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(pkey)

token = JWT.encode(payload, priv_key, 'RS256')

puts token
```

The important part is happening at the bottom: `JWT.encode` encodes the payload of the POST request, which consists of the API key from the service account.
Specifically, the secret of the respective key pair (named `priv_key` here) is used to encrypt the payload.

Next, this JWT needs to be passed to the `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` endpoint to ask for a *Bearer* access token by using the following payload in the body:

```yml
- name: "Google Workspace: Get access token from Google oauth2"
  uri:
    url: "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
    method: POST
    body: "grant_type={% raw %}{{ google_workspace_oauth2_grant_type }}&assertion={{ jwt.stdout }}{% endraw %}"
    return_content: true
  register: token
```

Here, `google_workspace_oauth2_grant_type` needs to be `"urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Ajwt-bearer"`.
This tells the endpoint that we are handing over a JWT token and want to get a *Bearer* token back.

Finally, this (short-lived) *Bearer* token can be used to issue the desired API call, e.g. creating a new user:

```yml
- name: "Google Workspace: Create user"
  uri:
    method: POST
    url: https://admin.googleapis.com/admin/directory/v1/users
    headers:
      authorization: "Bearer {% raw %}{{ token.json.access_token }}{% endraw %}"
    body_format: json
    body: '{
           "primaryEmail": "{% raw %}{{ username }}{% endraw %}@email.com",
           "password": "{% raw %}{{ user_password }}{% endraw %}",
           "name": {
             "givenName": "{% raw %}{{ first_name }}{% endraw %}",
             "familyName": "{% raw %}{{ last_name }}{% endraw %}"
           },
           "isAdmin": "{% raw %}{{ admin }}{% endraw %}"
         }'
```

## Summary

The OAuth2-API-Auth process to authenticate against the Google API is quite cumbersome and quite a few little things can go wrong.
As for all other methods, it is not possible to say how long this method will stay functional.
JWTs are a quite promising concept and it is likely that they will be around for quite some time as they are considered pretty save.
The biggest challenge is usually to puzzle all bits together and find the correct documentation resource for the respective provider.
Once it works, there's almost no overhead when using tools like Ansible to automate the process.

It should be noted that the approach is quite generic: for some providers you might need to change the encoding algorithm when creating the JWT (e.g. for Zoom it needs to be `HS256`) but other than that you should be able to reuse the `jwt.rb` script.
