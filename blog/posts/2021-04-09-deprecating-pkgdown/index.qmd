Websites for R packages built with [{pkgdown}](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) have become a de-facto standard over the last few years.
Many R packages build their site during Continuous Integration (CI) runs, pushing the assets to the special `gh-pages` branch (even though now [any branch can be used to deploy a website](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-09-03-build-and-deploy-github-pages-from-any-branch/)).

Sometimes, repositories are transferred to a new user/organization or the package is renamed.
While GitHub takes care of redirecting repository URLs, the pkgdown URLs (`https://<username>.github.io/<rpackage>`) are not redirected.
Since some users might have bookmarked specific URLs or the URLs appear in their browsing history, it would be great if these links do not return a 404.

This blog post proposes several ways to handle this gracefully:

- Redirection
- Deprecation with CSS
- Deprecation via bulk edit

All options hinge on the observation that users and organizations can create a [user or organization site](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites) that will be the source for `https://<username>.github.io/<package>` after the renaming.
The user site will also serve `robots.txt` that advises crawlers to avoid deprecated contents.

## User or organization site

In GitHub, users can create a *user repository* `<username>/<username>.github.io`.
This repo will be served automatically as a web page on `https://<username>.github.io/` .
In this repo, a directory can be created which corresponds to the respective GitHub Pages site of the original repo.
Example: The `rpackage/` directory in the `<username>/<username>.github.io` repository corresponds to `https://<username>.github.io/rpackage`.
If both `<username>/<rpackage>` and `<username>/<username>.github.io/<rpackage>` exist, the former takes precedence.
This means that you can prepare everything in your user repository `<username>/<username>.github.io` and it will work immediately after you rename your package repository.
The following has worked for <https://krlmlr.github.io/fledge/>, which has moved to <https://cynkra.github.io/fledge/>:

- Create repository `<username>/<username>.github.io`
- In `<username>/<username>.github.io` create directory `<rpackage>`
- Populate the `<rpackage>` directory using one of the methods described below
- Push to GitHub
- Rename repository

All of this works the same way for organizations.
The [munch package](https://cynkra.github.io/munch/) was previously located at <https://cynkra.github.io/SwissCommunes/>
The original pages, with a warning, are defined at [cynkra/cynkra.github.io](https://github.com/cynkra/cynkra.github.io/).


## Redirection

Basic idea: set up an HTML redirect from `https://<username-old>.github.io/<package>` to `https://<username-new>.github.io/<package>`.

To achieve this, create an `index.html` in `<username>/<username>.github.io/rpackage` with the following contents:

```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=<url to redirect to>" />
```

However, some redirection practices like this one are considered bad practice ("Use of meta refresh is discouraged by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).")[^1].
Also, users might find it sketchy to see some redirection happening shortly after they visited a site.
Last, the redirection shown above only works for the top-level domain.
Level 2 or level 3 links like `<url>/level1/level2` will not work and return a 404.

## Deprecation via CSS

A better way to deprecate a pkgdown/GitHub Pages site is to serve a static version of the last state before the package was moved, and add information to the user that the site has moved.

An easy way to achieve this is to include a little CSS snippet.
The following will add a colored line before the `page-header` div in the pkgdown site.

```css
.page-header:after {
  content: "You are viewing an outdated page which is not going to be updated anymore. Please go to <https:/new-url.com> for the latest version.";
  font-size: 12px;
  font-style: italic;
  color: #f03333;
}
```

<br>

Place this code in the `pkgdown/` directory of your package and it will be automatically picked up when the site is built next time:

- In your package, add the CSS snippet from above to `pkgdown/extra.css` (CSS name can be different) in the repository/R package which should be deprecated
- Call `pkgdown::build_site()` one last time
- Copy the contents of `docs/` to `<username>/<username>.github.io/<packagename>`

Unfortunately, the `:after` operator does not allow hyperlinks, so the new URL will not be clickable.


## Deprecation via bulk edit

For the URL to be clickable, the HTML files must be edited.
The `find`, `xargs` and `sed` utilities help to automate this.

pkgdown uses the Bootstrap framework, which has [alerts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#alerts) that serve the purpose.
They look best just before the closing `</header>` element.
The following command line adds an alert to each HTML page, advertising <https://cynkra.github.io/munch> as the target URL.
It must be run in the `rpackage` directory of `<username>/<username>.github.io`:

```sh
find -name "*.html" |
  xargs sed -i -r 's#(^.*[<]/header[>])#<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><strong>Warning!</strong> This content has moved to <a href="https://cynkra.github.io/munch">https://cynkra.github.io/munch</a>.</div>\n\1#'
```

This assumes GNU `sed`.
MacOS users will need to use `gsed`, or `-i.bak` instead of `-i` and deal with the leftover `*.bak` files.

Always advertising the new root works well enough because it is very likely that the structure of the site will eventually change after the repository rename.

## Web crawlers

It is a good idea to make the deprecated contents invisible to web crawlers.
Add a file [`robots.txt`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/create-robots-txt) to the root of `<username>/<username>.github.io`.
The following contents forbids crawling the [`/SwissCommunes/` directory](https://cynkra.github.io/SwissCommunes/) which contains the old snapshot with pointers to the new location:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /SwissCommunes/
```
