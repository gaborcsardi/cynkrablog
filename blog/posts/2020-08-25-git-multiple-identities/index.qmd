When committing to a Git repository related to my consulting work, I must use my company e-mail address, kirill@cynkra.com. Not so much for my open-source work -- for this, I prefer to use other e-mail addresses, like krlmlr+r@mailbox.org . (For example, Travis CI sends notification e-mails to the committer's e-mail address, and I have set up filtering for that other address.)

Having to configure the e-mail address for each repository separately eventually gets annoying. Instead, I'd rather have all repos within a specific subdirectory use particular e-mail address.

All my Git repos live in `~/git`. Subdirectories `R` and `cynkra`, contain R packages and repos related to consulting, respectively. To achieve the desired setup, I edit my `~/.gitconfig` with the following entry:

```
[includeIf "gitdir:git/**"]
    path = git/.gitconfig
```

This ensures that all repos in the `git` directory use the `git/.gitconfig` file in addition to the main configuration. That file contains the following:

```
[includeIf "gitdir:R/**"]
    path = R/.gitconfig
[includeIf "gitdir:cynkra/**"]
    path = cynkra/.gitconfig
```

Finally, in `~/git/R/.gitconfig` and `~/git/cynkra/.gitconfig`, I configure the e-mail addresses I want to use for all repos pertaining to `R` and `cynkra`, respectively.

```
[user]
    email = ...
```

I verify the setup with `git config -l | grep user`. Indeed, cynkra repos use the cynkra e-mail address. Voilà!

The above approach requires a recent-ish version of `git`- version 2.14 or later should suffice. Read more about [conditional includes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_conditional_includes).
