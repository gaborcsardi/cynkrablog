The [dm](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/) package reduces your mental strain when working with many tables. It connects your data, while still keeping them in their original tables. You can easily perform operations on all tables, visualize how they're connected, and integrate databases.

Rather than writing out the relational structure in code while connecting the sources, [dm](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/) packages them in data. This workflow prevents you from inconsistently updating tables, making copies due to redundancies and, more generally, losing track of decisions made in a data pipeline.

### A case study

To demonstrate [dm](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/)'s benefits, let's compare some workflows using data from the [nycflights13](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) package.

We want to get the data to analyze arrival delays of flights of planes built more than 30 years ago. For these flights, we also want to check if they departed for destinations in the south.
We use methods from the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package, the grammar for data manipulation from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

This requires columns `lon` (longitude) from table `airports`, `year` from table `planes` and `arr_delay` (arrival delay) from `flights`. We can do this by performing multiple joins, one after another, as you might be used to:


```r
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
```


```r
planes_join <- planes %>%
  rename(production_year_plane = year) %>%
  left_join(flights, by = "tailnum") %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  select(lon, year, production_year_plane, dest)

planes_join %>%
  filter(production_year_plane < 1983)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1,432 x 4
##      lon  year production_year_plane dest
##    <dbl> <int>                 <int> <chr>
##  1 -95.3  2013                  1965 IAH
##  2 -95.3  2013                  1965 IAH
##  3 -95.3  2013                  1965 IAH
##  4 -95.3  2013                  1965 IAH
##  5 -87.9  2013                  1959 ORD
##  6 -97.0  2013                  1959 DFW
##  7 -97.0  2013                  1959 DFW
##  8 -97.0  2013                  1959 DFW
##  9 -90.4  2013                  1959 STL
## 10 -97.0  2013                  1959 DFW
## # … with 1,422 more rows
```

Fair enough, you might say — to keep an overview, we can reduce the 34 columns using `select()`, then `filter()`. But what do you do once there are 30 tables, possibly from databases you're working with? Is this still a workable solution? And how sure are we that we truly only need these three columns?

### dm

On your [dm](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/) object, you can directly apply operations like `filter()` to _all_ your tables!
How so? Because relations between the objects are already registered in the [dm](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/) object, you don't need to indicate them.

Not having to state how tables are connected each time you perform a join may make exploratory work a lot easier:


```r
library(dm)
cdm_nycflights13() %>%
  cdm_filter(planes, year < 1983)
```

```
## ── Table source ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## src:  <package: nycflights13>
## ── Data model ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Data model object:
##   5 tables:  airlines, airports, flights, planes ...
##   53 columns
##   3 primary keys
##   3 references
## ── Rows ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Total: 27583
## airlines: 4, airports: 3, flights: 1432, planes: 29, weather: 26115
```

This produces an overview of your data sources — all tables still separated. Also note: there was no need to `rename()` the column `year`, and all tables stay separate.

What if you still wanted to produce a join and check where those flights departed to?
Voilà:


```r
cdm_nycflights13() %>%
  cdm_filter(planes, year < 1983) %>%
  cdm_join_tbl(flights, airports)
```

```

### Visualization

You can easily gain a visual overview using `cdm_draw()`. This results in pretty, customizable (using `cdm_set_colors()`) visualizations of how your data connect.


```r
cdm_nycflights13() %>%
  cdm_set_colors(
    flights = "blue_nb",
    airlines = "orange_nb",
    weather = "green_nb",
    airports = "yellow_nb",
    planes = "light_grey_nb"
  ) %>%
  cdm_draw()
```

### Databases

[dm](https://krlmlr.github.io/dm/) works for both in-memory data and databases. You can easily integrate it into your [dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) workflow, making for new, powerful ways of analysis.
